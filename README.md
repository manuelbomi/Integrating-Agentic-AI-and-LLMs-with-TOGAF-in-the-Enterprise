# Integrating-Agentic-AI-and-LLMs-with-TOGAF-in-the-Enterprise

#### These set of project demonstrates how an Agentic AI system — powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o LLM, OpenAI vector embeddings, Pinecone vector database, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Kubernetes Services, Azure CLI, Langchain, Streamlit, Prometheus, Grafana, Google Cloud Platform and n8n orchestration — can be effectively mapped to the TOGAF ADM (Architecture Development Method) to support intelligent automation within an enterprise context. 

#### Rather than viewing AI as an isolated capability, this implementation positions it as a modular, governable, and incrementally scalable architecture component that aligns directly with the enterprise TOGAF (Open Group Architecture Framework) principles.
