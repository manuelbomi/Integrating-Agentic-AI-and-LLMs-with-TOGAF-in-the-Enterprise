# Integrating Agentic AI and LLMs with TOGAF in the Enterprise

#### These set of project demonstrates how an Agentic AI system ‚Äî powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o LLM, OpenAI vector embeddings, Pinecone vector database, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Kubernetes Services, Azure CLI, Langchain, Streamlit, Prometheus, Grafana, Google Cloud Platform and n8n orchestration ‚Äî can be effectively mapped to the TOGAF ADM (Architecture Development Method) to support intelligent automation within an enterprise context. 

#### Rather than viewing AI as an isolated capability, this implementation positions it as a modular, governable, and incrementally scalable architecture component that aligns directly with the enterprise TOGAF (Open Group Architecture Framework) principles.

## Phase A: Architecture Vision  üß≠
#### The goal of the Agentic AI system is to advance the enterprise vision of real-time intelligent automation with autonomous AI Agents that learns from the environments and increases its intelligence and capabilities. 

#### By leveraging vector databases like Pinecone in combination with large language models (LLMs), the agent dynamically interacts with business knowledge and user context without requiring model retraining. 

#### This directly supports enterprise-level goals such as business agility, self-service intelligence, and lower time-to-decision. 

#### The n8n-based agentic and LLM workflow thus becomes a tangible proof-of-concept for broader enterprise AI adoption. In a nutshell, in these set of projects, in the architecture vision phase, we:

        ‚ó¶ Show how Agentic AI supports the vision of enterprise-wide intelligent automation by connecting business goals with AI capabilities.
		
        ‚ó¶ Example: Using Pinecone + LLMs in several contexts ensures real-time knowledge integration without retraining, aligning with ‚Äúbusiness agility‚Äù goals.

---

## Phase B: Business Architecture  üèõÔ∏è 
#### From a business perspective, the AI agent acts as an intelligent assistant capable of handling real workflows ‚Äî such as enterprise data pipeline orchestration and event/meeting scheduling ‚Äî using the enterprise data. 

#### It supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from the Pinecone vector store, allowing the reuse of internal documentation and knowledge assets across teams. 

#### This breaks down data silos and aligns with TOGAF's vision of reusable, shared capabilities. The agent is designed to be extensible ‚Äî future versions could handle financial analysis, aid enterprise-wide troubleshooting and project assistance, or detailed customer interactions (as shown in project 5).  

#### In a nutshell, in the business architecture phase, across all the projects (1 ‚Äì 6), we:

        ‚ó¶ Position the AI agent as a business enabler that can handle RAG workflows, event scheduling & management, or financial analysis.
		
        ‚ó¶ Emphasize enterprise data reuse: no silos, just embeddings across shared knowledge bases.
